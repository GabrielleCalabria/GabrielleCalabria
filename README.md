# Hi! I'm Gabrielle 👋✨  

I'm a **career switcher** transitioning into **UX/UI, Web Design, and Front-end**, focused on learning by doing and building real projects throughout the process.

🎯 Looking for opportunities as:
- Web Developer (junior)

## 🧠 What I’m building

I don’t have professional experience in the field yet, but I’m actively developing:
- Practical study projects  
- Applied exercises with a focus on usability and interface design  
- Experiments that connect design and development  

My goal is to **continuously improve**, learning from each project and from feedback.
